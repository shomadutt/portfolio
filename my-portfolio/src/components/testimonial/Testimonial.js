        Yoga For Life has been my saving grace! I can not say enough about Dee,
        and her knowledge of the practice but also of kinaesthetics. Yoga has
        brought me physical health, but more importantly peace and an over all
        feeling of well being! I feel fortunate to practice at such a welcoming
        studio and will be forever grateful for the knowledge I have gained!

        The first time I walked into the Yoga For Life studio I felt so at home.
        Dee was amazing, she made me feel like I was the most important student
        in the class. She encouraged me to try new poses and encouraged me to
        reach the next level. Every time I finish a class I feel taller and
        stronger and I thank my body for what it can do. Thanks to Dee at Yoga
        For Life!!!
